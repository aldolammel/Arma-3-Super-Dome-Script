# Arma 3 / SD: Super Dome v1.5.1
>*Dependencies: none.*

SD is an Arma 3 script that's a smart protection against damage for players, vehicles, and AI units when they are within pre-defined zones. The protected zones have automatic removal of wrecks and rolled-over vehicles, in addition to small automation relating to the protected zone's integrity. Super-Dome script works both at the server layer and on each player's machine, allowing the editor to turn resources ON and OFF.

Creation concept: turn specific game zones into safe places for players, areas proof against their enemies and themselves.
